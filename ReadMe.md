## About

**Pacific Climate Heroes** is a game-based learning tool that empowers players to engage with climate resilience and environmental action through Pacific Island stories and ecosystems.

This digital prototype recreates the board in-browser with interactive drag-and-drop tokens over a custom background and hexagonal grid. The prototype supports playtesting, UI development, and integration planning before physical production.

Designed for:

* Environmental education programs
* Community resilience workshops
* School curricula
* NGOs and partners promoting climate literacy

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+)
* Git
* A modern web browser

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jhsizemore/Pacific-Climate-Heroes.git
cd Pacific-Climate-Heroes

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:5173/`

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

This project uses the [AI Dev Tasks for Cursor](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks) workflow — a lightweight system of `.mdc` (Markdown Command) files that guide AI-assisted development inside the [Cursor editor](https://cursor.sh/). This provides a structured, reviewable way to build features with AI help.

### Development Phases:

1. **PRD Creation** – Create a detailed Product Requirement Document using `create-prd.mdc`.
2. **Task Generation** – Break the PRD into a step-by-step implementation plan using `generate-tasks.mdc`.
3. **Task Execution** – Guide the AI to complete tasks one-by-one with `process-task-list.mdc`.
4. **Approval & Iteration** – Review each task’s output, provide feedback or approve.
5. **Progress Tracking** – Visually track which features are done and what’s next.

This process keeps the AI grounded, iterative, and responsive to design needs.
*Great for fast-moving prototypes and clean code development.*

For convenience, this repository includes copies of the `.mdc` files in the
`tasks/` directory so you can run the workflow locally without fetching them
manually.

## Usage

Once the app is running:

1. The board displays a Pacific Island background with a transparent hex grid.
2. Tokens can be clicked and dragged across the grid.
3. The project supports modular tokens, responsive layout, and dynamic asset updates.
4. Future versions will integrate turns, rulesets, event cards, and player logic.
